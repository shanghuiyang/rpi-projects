Using the [rpi-devices](https://github.com/shanghuiyang/rpi-devices) library, I built several projects based on raspberry pi. The most complex app is the [self-driving car](/projects/car), more than 10 sensers were used to build the car. I highlight few funny apps here, please go to [projects](/projects) for all projects I developed.
